# Introduction

This post builds on the information presented in the [previous post](./../orange-grapefruit-logistic-regression-pt1/) covering the math behind logistic regression.

# Minor Data Exploration
- graphs

# Python Implementation
## Label Encoding & Feature Scaling
- different types of feature scaling
- why do we do feature scaling
- StandardScaler() uses z-score normalization

## Fitting the model

## Evaluating the model
