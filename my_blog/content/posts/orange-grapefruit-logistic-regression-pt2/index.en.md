# Introduction

This post builds upon the information presented in the previous post: "The Math that Powers Logistic Regression (Citrus Classification)"

# Minor Data Exploration
- graphs

# Python Implementation
## Label Encoding & Feature Scaling
- different types of feature scaling
- why do we do feature scaling
- StandardScaler() uses z-score normalization

## Fitting the model

## Evaluating the model
